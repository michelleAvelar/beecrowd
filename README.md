# Test Automation with Cypress - BEECROWD

This repository contains a basic test automation project using Cypress.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 12 or higher)
- npm (Node.js package manager)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/michelleAvelar/beecrowd.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd your-repository
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running Tests

To run tests in headless mode (without a graphical interface):

```bash
npm run cy:run
```

To open the Cypress graphical interface:

```bash
npm run open
```

## Generating and Opening the Mochawesome Report

To generate and open the Mochawesome report, follow these steps:

1. **Run Tests:**

    First, run the tests to generate the necessary JSON reports:

    ```bash
    npm run cy:run
    ```

2. **Generate and Open the Report:**

    After the tests have run, use the following command to generate and open the Mochawesome report:

    ```bash
    npm run generate:report
    ```

This script performs the following steps:

- Merges all JSON reports generated by Mochawesome into a single JSON file located at `cypress/reports/merged-report.json`.
- Uses the merged JSON file to generate a consolidated HTML report.
- Automatically opens the generated HTML report in your default browser.

## Custom Scripts

The following custom scripts are available in the `package.json` file for improved automation:

- **Clean Reports:**

    Cleans up the reports directory before running tests:

    ```bash
    npm run clean:reports
    ```

- **Run Cypress Tests:**

    Cleans reports and runs tests in headless mode:

    ```bash
    npm run cy:run
    ```

- **Open Cypress GUI:**

    Opens the Cypress graphical interface:

    ```bash
    npm run open
    ```

- **Generate Consolidated Mochawesome Report:**

    Merges JSON reports, generates an HTML report, and opens it:

    ```bash
    npm run generate:report
    ```
